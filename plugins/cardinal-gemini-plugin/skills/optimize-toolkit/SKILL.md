# Cardinal Optimize Toolkit

Use this skill when the user explicitly asks Gemini CLI to optimize
their toolkit, mine their own session history for capability-fit
recommendations, or review whether a recurring inline pattern should
become a reusable sub-agent. It is **not** a skill to reach for
opportunistically just because the conversation is adjacent to agents
or tooling — see **What not to do** below for why.

A **per-user, past-informed, future-effective** optimizer — not a
session-local one. It looks at your own last 30 days of sessions
(recurrence across ≥5 is the admission bar the server applies before a
candidate ever reaches this skill), pitches the top few candidates with
their evidence, and — only on your explicit confirmation — writes the
accepted artifact to this working tree. **Anything written takes effect
next session**, not this one: Gemini CLI loads custom subagent
definitions (`.gemini/agents/*.md`) at startup, the same as
`~/.gemini/settings.json` and the extension directory — there is no
live-registration channel, so accepting a candidate here will not
change what happens for the rest of this conversation. (`/agents
reload` reloads the agent registry without a full restart if the user's
Gemini CLI version supports it — mention it as an option, but the
"takes effect next session" framing below is still the safe default to
tell the user.)

This burns your own session tokens to run. It is built to be cheap by
construction: the server (conductor's maestro, via the `cardinal` MCP
server) authors every number and every artifact body — this skill never
re-analyzes your repo, never invents a savings figure, and never spawns
a sub-agent to do its own investigating. If a candidate needs more than
cosmetic adaptation (renaming, trimming a tool allowlist), that is a
server-side gap to report, not something to improvise here.

## Before you start

This skill orchestrates eight `outcomes__*` tools served by the
`cardinal` MCP server (see the `cardinal-connect` skill — same server,
same consent). They are documented in conductor's
`docs/specs/optimize-toolkit-mcp-tools.md`:

1. `outcomes__my_turn_pattern`
2. `outcomes__my_toolkit_adoption`
3. `outcomes__cluster_spawns`
4. `outcomes__org_offered_tiers`
5. `outcomes__estimate_savings`
6. `outcomes__generate_agent_spec`
7. `outcomes__mark`

`outcomes__my_recent_spawns` also exists on the same server — it's a
raw spawn history for ad-hoc debugging, not part of this flow. Reach
for it only if the user explicitly asks "what did I spawn recently?".

**Check your available tools before doing anything else.** As of this
writing, the maestro routes behind these tools are live, but the
mcp-gateway `outcomes/` package that exposes them as *callable MCP
tools* is a separate, not-yet-shipped follow-up. If none of the
`outcomes__*` tools appear in your tool list (they'd show under the
`cardinal` MCP server, alongside whatever other integrations this org
has configured), say so plainly and stop:

> "The optimize-toolkit tools aren't wired into this org's Cardinal MCP
> server yet — that's a known rollout gap, not a problem with your
> connection. Nothing to do here yet."

Do not attempt a substitute analysis (no reading transcripts, no
grepping local logs, no falling back to "let me look at your repo
instead"). This mirrors the spec's silent-failure rule: MCP unreachable
or empty candidates → one line, stop, no retries.

## How you (Gemini CLI) should run this

Budget: usually 5–7 tool calls total, ≤10 in the worst case. Stay inside
it — this is a "thin skill" by design; the intelligence is server-side.

### 1. Open — situational-awareness bundle (2 calls)

Call `outcomes__my_turn_pattern` and `outcomes__my_toolkit_adoption`,
both with `window: "30d"`. From the two responses, compose a short
(≤6 line) opening paragraph before mentioning any candidate:

- State the evidence window explicitly ("based on your last 30 days of
  sessions") — never let the opening imply "this session."
- Name the caller's top 1–2 model-mix rows by cost from
  `my_turn_pattern.models`.
- Name the toolkit-adoption headline the first candidate will target,
  e.g. "42 tool-call spawns / 480k tokens on a reasoning-tier model in
  the last 30 days" (from `my_toolkit_adoption.agents` or `.skills`).
- **No usable evidence, stop before any ratio math.** If
  `my_toolkit_adoption.coverage.sessions_scanned == 0`, or
  `my_turn_pattern.turns_total` is 0, there is nothing to compute a
  coverage ratio from — say "no optimization candidates right now, not
  enough session history yet" and stop. Never divide by
  `sessions_scanned` before this check passes.
- **Coverage caveat.** The 8-tool contract doesn't ship one unified
  `enriched_share` field (an earlier draft of the skill spec assumed a
  single bundle response with that shape; the shipped tool contract
  splits it per-tool instead — treat the per-tool `coverage` objects as
  authoritative). Use `my_toolkit_adoption.coverage.sessions_with_tier_attribution
  / coverage.sessions_scanned` as the enrichment-coverage proxy —
  `sessions_with_tier_attribution` is the subset where `tok_by_model`
  is actually populated (v0.12.x-equivalent fields present), which is
  what this skill's savings math depends on; it's the closest available
  stand-in for the `enriched_share` the original spec draft described
  (see `optimize-toolkit-mcp-tools.md:214-218`). Treat
  `sessions_with_toolkit_data / sessions_scanned` as a **separate,
  secondary** check — "does the plugin see this user at all" — worth
  mentioning if it diverges sharply from the tier-attribution ratio
  (e.g. a very-online-but-pre-enrichment user), but don't gate the
  caveat on it: a user can score 1.0 on toolkit-data presence while
  still being at 0 on tier attribution, and it's the latter that
  governs whether a savings number is grounded. When the
  tier-attribution ratio is under 0.5, prepend a one-line caveat:
  "evidence from N/M of your sessions in the last 30 days — coverage
  will climb as you keep working on a current plugin version." Also
  check `my_turn_pattern.coverage.plugin_versions_seen` — if it shows a
  stale version for recent turns, mention the plugin-version-drift
  possibility and suggest a Gemini CLI restart.

If `my_turn_pattern.turns_total` or `my_toolkit_adoption` shows nothing
usable (near-zero coverage), say so and stop — do not manufacture a
pitch from thin data.

### 2. Discover (1 call)

Call `outcomes__cluster_spawns` with `window: "30d"` (defaults:
`min_jaccard: 0.4`, `min_cluster_size: 3` — leave as-is unless the
conversation gives you a reason to tune them). This tool does not judge
which clusters are worth pitching — **that's your job, adaptively, in
this conversation.** Rank by `total_cost_usd` (fall back to
`total_tokens` when cost is null) and recurrence; drop anything with
`recurrence < 3` even if it slipped through, and prefer clusters with a
higher `with_description_share` in `coverage` (clustering is weaker
without descriptions).

Take the top **K = 3** clusters forward. If fewer than 3 clear clusters
exist, present fewer — do not pad with weak candidates to hit the
number.

### 3. Score (1 + up to K calls)

Call `outcomes__org_offered_tiers` once — this tells you the org's
actual `cheap` and `reasoning` model tiers. **Never suggest a model the
org isn't offered**; if a tier is `null`, that door is closed for this
org.

For each of the top-K clusters, call `outcomes__estimate_savings` with
the cluster's token/model data and a `target_tier`. Choosing
`target_tier` and the eventual `kind` (next step) is this skill's
judgment call — the tools score a proposal, they don't propose one for
you:

- Cluster's `current_model` already matches the org's `cheap` tier →
  there's no tiering headroom; this cluster is a candidate for
  `extract` (mint a reusable capability) or `consolidate`
  (near-duplicate of something that already exists), not `pin`/
  `downgrade`. **Still call `estimate_savings` with `target_tier:
  "cheap"`** — the savings will be ~0 honestly, but the call keeps
  `target_tier` grounded for the compose step that follows, and
  confirms there's truly no delta rather than assuming it. Never skip
  the call.
- Cluster runs on a `reasoning`-tier or unresolved model and the work
  looks mechanical (tight `tool_signature` — use `jaccard_within` as
  the proxy, `≥ 0.6` is a defensible starting threshold;
  `TODO(reviewer)` on the exact value) → `target_tier: "cheap"`, kind
  candidate `pin` or `downgrade`.
- Cluster's `tool_signature` looks like it's duplicating an existing
  named capability you can see in `my_toolkit_adoption` → kind
  candidate `adopt` (stop minting the inline pattern, use the existing
  one) or `swap` (existing capability is the wrong shape/model, needs
  replacing).
- Two or more clusters look like near-duplicates of each other →
  `consolidate`.
- **D5 outcome gate**: `adopt`/`swap`/`pin`/`downgrade` require the
  cohort outcome signal to be present for this candidate. Pick your
  best-guess `kind` here from the signals above — the gate itself is
  validated authoritatively after `outcomes__generate_agent_spec` in
  step 5 (Compose), which returns `outcome_backed` / `kind_supported`
  directly (cardinalhq/conductor#1322). No inference from errors or
  body shape needed.
- If nothing in the cluster fits any artifact-bearing kind, it's a
  `gap` — a signal worth naming in conversation ("you keep doing X by
  hand; there's no fitting capability for it yet") with **no artifact
  and no `generate_agent_spec` call**.

Read `estimate.assumptions.placeholder_output_ratio` /
`placeholder_cache_ratio` and `estimate.estimate` on every response —
see **Placeholder savings, honestly** below before you say a dollar
figure out loud.

### 4. Present (no tool call)

One candidate at a time, top-K by headline savings, each with:

- The evidence summary in plain language (not a raw JSON dump).
- The `matching_sessions` slice if present, referenced inline ("this
  would have covered your session on Jul 6"), not as a bare count.
- The full artifact body you'd write (from step 5 — call
  `outcomes__generate_agent_spec` before presenting, not after
  confirming, since "full artifact before any confirmation question" is
  the contract).
- The savings figure, honestly caveated per placeholder rules.
- An explicit confirmation question. Do not proceed to writing on
  silence, "not now," or a topic change — see **Marking honestly**.

### 5. Compose (1 call per candidate you present)

Call `outcomes__generate_agent_spec` with the cluster's id, the chosen
`target_tier`, and the chosen `kind` (one of `extract`, `pin`,
`downgrade`, `adopt`, `swap`, `consolidate` — never `gap`, which has no
artifact). This is a **server-authored** artifact — you do not compose
the markdown; you present it and, on confirmation, write it verbatim
(cosmetic adaptation only: renaming to fit repo conventions, trimming an
obviously-irrelevant tool from the allowlist), subject to the
render-target note below.

**D5 outcome gate — read directly.** The response carries
`outcome_backed: boolean` and `kind_supported: boolean`
(cardinalhq/conductor#1322). Read both before presenting the candidate:

- If `kind_supported === false`, fall back to kind `extract` and tell
  the user plainly why: "this recommendation kind needs cohort outcome
  data your sessions don't have populated yet — falling back to
  `extract`."
- Never present or write a `pin`/`downgrade`/`adopt`/`swap` artifact
  when `outcome_backed === false` — this is a hard gate.
- This is independent of the `warning: "artifact_kind_not_yet_specialized"`
  field described below in **Known gap** — that flags body
  specialization (FU-1), not D5 outcome validity. Both can appear on
  the same response.

**Render-target note — be honest about it.** `outcomes__generate_agent_spec`
was designed against Claude Code's shape: a markdown file with YAML
frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `model`, a prose instruction body).
Gemini CLI's native custom-subagent format is **also** a markdown file
with YAML frontmatter, at `.gemini/agents/<name>.md`, with fields
`name`, `description`, `kind` (`local` or `remote`), `tools` (array,
supports wildcards like `*` / `mcp_*`), `mcpServers`, `model`,
`temperature`, `max_turns`, and `timeout_mins`. This is the closest of
the three ports to a lossless map — unlike codex (TOML, no tool
allowlist field) and cursor (no tool allowlist field), Gemini's format
does carry a `tools` field the server's `tools:`/`tool_allowlist:`
frontmatter can map into:

- spec's `name` / `description` / prose body → map straight across, no
  reformatting.
- spec's `tools:` / `tool_allowlist:` list → Gemini's `tools` array,
  one entry per tool name, copied across as literal names (not
  wildcards) unless the user asks you to broaden a group into a
  wildcard pattern. If a listed tool name doesn't obviously correspond
  to a Gemini-visible tool (naming conventions can differ slightly
  across MCP surfaces), say so in the dry-run rather than silently
  dropping or renaming it — surface the mismatch, let the user decide.
- **model precedence:** same rule as the codex and cursor adapters —
  `org_offered_tiers`'s resolved `target_model_id` always wins over the
  server-frontmatter `model:` for the `.gemini/agents/<name>.md`
  `model` field, since the org's currently-offered tiers are the source
  of truth for what actually works in this org today. If the two
  differ, don't error — log the disagreement in the dry-run explanation
  ("server suggested `<server-model>`, using org's `<tier>` tier
  `<target_model_id>` instead").
- leave `kind` (defaults to `local`), `mcpServers`, `temperature`,
  `max_turns`, and `timeout_mins` **unset**, letting Gemini CLI's own
  defaults apply — none of the 8 tools supply source data for them, and
  guessing a value would be inventing content the server didn't author.
  If the user wants one set, ask them for the value explicitly rather
  than defaulting it yourself.

`TODO(reviewer)`: the `.gemini/agents/<name>.md` render-target path and
field shape above are sourced from Gemini CLI's published docs
(geminicli.com/docs/core/subagents) captured during this port, not a
live smoke test against an installed Gemini CLI — no Gemini CLI install
is available in this repo's test environment. Same caveat as the codex
adapter's `.codex/agents/<name>.toml` target (tracked there as
cardinalhq/cardinal-agent-plugins#20); if this skill's dry-run ever
produces a file Gemini CLI doesn't actually load, that's the
render-target assumption to revisit first.

**Known gap — be honest about it, independent of the render-target note
above.** `outcomes__generate_agent_spec` today emits the same shape of
markdown body regardless of `kind` (flagged in the harvester review as
FU-1, not yet closed as of this writing). That means a `pin` or `adopt`
recommendation may come back reading like a freshly-minted agent even
though nothing about the role is actually new. **Say what kind you're
rendering and where the target file would go even when the body itself
is generic** — do not let a generic body imply the recommendation is
less grounded than it is (the evidence and savings numbers are still
real; only the prose body is currently kind-blind). Per kind:

| kind | what it means | target file | what to do given the generic-body gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| `extract` | mint a genuinely new capability from a recurring inline cluster | new file: `.gemini/agents/<suggested_name>.md` | Body is expected to be generic-shaped here — this is the one kind `generate_agent_spec` was designed for. Write as-is (after the render-target mapping above). |
| `pin` | keep the existing capability, change only its model tier | existing `.gemini/agents/<name>.md` if you can identify it from the conversation/repo; otherwise `.gemini/agents/<suggested_name>.md` as a fallback | Tell the user plainly: "this is a `pin` — the meaningful change is the `model` line, not a new role description. I'd normally just edit that one field on your existing agent file rather than replace it with this generic body; let me know which existing file this should target." Prefer a minimal edit over a full-body overwrite when you can locate the existing file. |
| `downgrade` | same as `pin` but framed as re-tiering an over-qualified capability down | same as `pin` | Same honesty note as `pin`. |
| `adopt` | stop minting this pattern inline; an existing capability already covers it | usually **no new file** | Say so directly: "this is an `adopt` — no new file is needed, `<existing capability>` already covers this. I'll skip writing anything; the actionable part is reaching for it next time." Only write something (e.g., a short note) if the user asks for a durable reminder. |
| `swap` | replace a capability with a better-fit existing one | the **existing** capability's file, if identifiable | Same posture as `adopt` — this is a pointer to something that already exists, not new content. Don't write a new agent file under this kind without the user explicitly asking for one. |
| `consolidate` | merge near-duplicate capabilities | the files being merged, once the user identifies them | `generate_agent_spec` doesn't return which files are duplicates — it only scores the cluster. Present the opportunity conversationally; don't attempt to auto-locate or auto-merge files. Only write once the user tells you which files are involved. |
| `gap` | no fitting capability exists | none — no artifact | Never call `generate_agent_spec` for this kind. Present as a signal only. |

`TODO(reviewer)`: this table is this skill's interpretation of how to
stay honest around the FU-1 generic-body gap and the render-target note
above — confirm both against product intent once `generate_agent_spec`
becomes kind-aware and, once the Gemini render target above is smoke-
tested, simplify accordingly.

### 6. Write (only on explicit confirmation)

**Validate the target-file basename before anything else.** The
`suggested_name` field is server-authored so this is defence in depth,
but names are used as path segments — reject if `suggested_name` (a)
contains `/` or `\`, (b) contains `..`, or (c) doesn't match
kebab-case `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$`. On rejection, surface the value
verbatim to the user with the specific reason and stop — do not
attempt a rewrite or a slugification pass.

**Dry-run first, always.** Before writing anything, show:

- The exact target file path (from the table above).
- Whether it's a new file or an edit to an existing one, and if an
  edit, which fields change (ideally just the `model` line for
  `pin`/`downgrade`).
- The full artifact body that would land (post-mapping, per step 5).
- A plain confirmation question ("write this to `.gemini/agents/
  <name>.md`? yes/no").

Only write after an explicit "yes"-shaped answer in the conversation.
No write on silence, hedging, or topic change. After writing, tell the
user this **takes effect next session** (Gemini CLI loads
`.gemini/agents/*.md` at startup; there is no live-registration channel
by default — same restart requirement the `cardinal-connect`/
`cardinal-disconnect` skills already ask for when they touch
`~/.gemini/settings.json` — though `/agents reload` may pick it up
without a restart if the user's Gemini CLI version supports it,
mention that as a secondary option) — never imply the current
conversation just changed. Consent, revert, and distribution are git:
the artifact lands in the working tree like any other change, reviewed
in the diff, reverted with `git checkout --`, shared via the repo.
There is no separate revoke/sync mechanism to explain.

### 7. Mark (1 call per candidate you presented)

**Exactly one `mark` call per candidate you showed, carrying its
terminal status.** Not one call per state transition, not a stream of
"presented → accepted" updates — the ledger reads the status as the
single terminal outcome. Don't double-mark. Pick from:

- `status: "accepted"` — confirmed and written.
- `status: "dismissed"` — **explicit refusal only** ("no," "don't want
  this"). Ask one short follow-up ("what didn't fit?") and forward the
  answer verbatim as `reason` (cap ~200 chars; do not paraphrase or
  classify it yourself — the raw text is the learning signal).
- `status: "presented"` — shown, no decision either way ("not now,"
  topic change, session ends without an answer). **Never auto-dismiss
  on non-confirmation** — hesitation must not read as a refusal;
  dismissals are sticky server-side (2× pooled-cost reopen) and
  poisoning that with a false dismissal is worse than a missed mark.

Use `action: { kind: "cluster", cluster_id, proposed_kind }` — these are
live cluster-derived decisions, not legacy ledger rows. Mark is
best-effort: if the call fails, don't error the conversation over it —
the artifact write (or its absence) is the real outcome; the ledger is
measurement, not the source of truth.

## Failure handling for non-`mark` tools

`mark` is the one tool that follows the silent-log rule above — every
other tool is on the hard-stop rule. If any of `my_turn_pattern`,
`my_toolkit_adoption`, `cluster_spawns`, `org_offered_tiers`,
`estimate_savings`, or `generate_agent_spec` returns `503`
(lakerunner-not-configured), `400` (invalid body), or an empty result
set where the flow depends on at least one row, **surface the error
verbatim to the user, stop the flow, do not retry**. An empty
`cluster_spawns` result means "no clusters cleared the recurrence
floor — nothing to pitch," not "try again with looser thresholds."

## Placeholder savings, honestly

Every `outcomes__estimate_savings` response carries fields that exist
specifically so you don't overstate a number:

- `estimate: "no_cohort_catalog_only"` means there's no cohort of other
  engineers/orgs to compare against yet — the figure is **catalog
  pricing math only**, not validated against how the tier actually
  performs for this kind of work. Say this out loud: "this is a
  catalog-only estimate — I don't have cohort data yet to confirm the
  cheaper tier holds up for this pattern; treat it as a ceiling, not a
  promise." Do not drop the caveat just because the number is
  attractive.
- `assumptions.placeholder_output_ratio` / `placeholder_cache_ratio` set
  to `true` mean the estimate fell back to typical ratios because the
  cluster didn't carry per-component token data. Say "estimated within
  a wide band" rather than quoting a bare point figure when either flag
  is set.
- When `current_cost_usd` is `null` (current model unpriced), don't
  imply a before/after delta — state the projected cost alone.

None of this blocks presenting the candidate — it changes how
confidently you say the number, not whether you say it.

## What not to do

- Don't re-analyze the repo beyond confirming a target file path exists
  or locating the existing file a `pin`/`downgrade`/`swap` targets.
- Don't spawn a sub-agent to do independent investigation — the server
  already computed everything you need.
- Don't invent a cohort comparison when a tool response says there
  isn't one.
- Don't write anything without an explicit "yes" in this conversation.
- Don't auto-invoke yourself opportunistically. Gemini CLI has no
  `disable-model-invocation`-style frontmatter gate the way the claude
  adapter does — there is no hard mechanism here, only this prose rule
  and a narrowly-scoped `description` field. Treat it as load-bearing
  anyway: only run this flow when the user explicitly asks to optimize
  their toolkit, review capability-fit recommendations, or names
  `cardinal-optimize-toolkit` directly. A loose topical match in the
  conversation is not sufficient grounds to start burning the tool
  budget below.
- Don't exceed the ~10-call budget; if you're reaching for more calls
  than that, stop and say the pipeline needs more than a thin skill can
  responsibly do here.
