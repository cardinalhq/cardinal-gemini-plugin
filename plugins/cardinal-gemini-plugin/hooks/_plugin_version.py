"""Resolve this plugin's canonical version at hook-execution time.

The version stamped on emitted telemetry (`cardinal.plugin_version`
resource attribute + OTel scope version) must reflect the plugin
package that is CURRENTLY installed, not a constant hardcoded in
source that developers have to remember to bump on every release.

Reading from the sibling `../.gemini-plugin/plugin.json` at every
hook execution keeps the stamp in lockstep with `plugin.json` — the
same file the marketplace and release tooling already own.
